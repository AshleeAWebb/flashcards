# Flashcards

### Abstract:
This application allows users to answer questions within the CLI(Command Line Interface). As they respond, they are notified of the correctness of the answer; the game continues until all questions have been answered, at which point a message appears on the screen informing the user of the percentage correct and that the game is over. 

### Technology Used

This application uses JavaScript ES6, GitHub, Git Flow, and Testing Framework Mocha/Chia. 

### Installation Instructions:

1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Type cd flashcards to move into the root directory

### Context:
I dedicated approximately 20 hours of work to this project; I used [Trello](https://trello.com/b/8U5PsbFN/mod-2-project-1) to break the task into more manageable pieces in the iteration.

### Additional Info:
This project was my first interaction with Test Driven Development. I better understood object-oriented programming principles, furthered my ability to write modular, reusable code, and gained experience using Git and GitHub for version control. I also kept up with good planning practices and created a Trello to track my progress and ensure that I was meeting requirements. I was very challenged in the Round Class due to the amount of information it needed to containand my unfamiliarity with writing my own testing. Still, by breaking it into smaller sections, writing the test, and then writing out the functions bit by bit, I got it functioning. I was also challenged by my unfamiliarity with the Game Class and how to work around to break down what I could test and how to instantiate the game. I overcame this challenge by reaching out for help and getting pointed in the right direction.
